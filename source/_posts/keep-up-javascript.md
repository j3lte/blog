I love Javascript! As a Front-end Developer it is essential that you keep up with the latest technologies, keep experimenting with new stuff. Keep your creativity flowing. So, how do you keep up?

## RSS

Subscribe to websites that give you in-depth tutorials! Myself, I have over 250 websites that I follow on [Feedly](http://feedly.com/ "Feedly"), categorized (also on other subjects like personal development). RSS is a lifesaver, no more browsing every website, but keep everything in one place.... I used to do this in Google Reader, unfortunately Google decided to [remove this service](http://googleblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html "A second spring of cleaning"). I can't share a list with subscribed websites from Feedly, but have a look at my [@j3ltedev account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/j3ltedev "J3ltedev on Twitter"). This automatically shares new articles that are on the subject of HTML5/CSS/JS in Feedly, through [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/ "If This That That").

## Twitter

Follow the websites on Twitter. I have [a list on Twitter](https://twitter.com/j3lte/lists/js "j3lte list: JS"), allthough this one isn't up to date. I like Feedly more... Need to do an update on all the websites. My list on [NodeJS](https://twitter.com/j3lte/lists/nodejs "j3lte list: NodeJS") is more comprehensive.

## Javascript Newsletters

Subscribe to newsletters. I have been an avid reader of [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/ "Javascript Weekly") since a year. It keeps up with the latest technologies. Take a look at the [latest issue](http://javascriptweekly.com/issues/171 "Javascript Weekly issue 171") here.

![Javascript: ECMAScript 6](http://jeltelagendijk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20130807-es6-150x150.png "ES6")

_For now, that's all. I had an interesting talk last week with two guys who are far more into Javascript than I am, so it seemed. They adviced me to have a look at the core Javascript and new technologies. So, for now, I will be focussing on Vanilla Javascript and the upcoming technologies that are described in the [ECMAScript 6 proposed guidelines](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html "ES6 Draft (Mozilla)"), the upcoming standard that will be ratified in December 2014 (expected). Have a look at this [awesome overview](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features "ES6 Features (Github)"). Let's dive into it!_

Please, if you have more tips on websites/newsletters and other in-depth websites on the subjects, feel free to comment!
