Push, pull, branch, pull requests, cherry-picking... No, these words do not come from some sort of bad C-rated adult movie... These are terms I work with on a daily basis, using [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software) "Git on Wikipedia"). In the past I have worked with [Subversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software) "Subversion on Wikipedia"), which was a total nightmare (in my humble opinion ofcourse, I do not want to offend people who like SVN). Version control comes in many flavors. Lately I have been working in several teams on various big projects, and so the need for version control of your code is necessary.

## Git GUI:

Personally, I like [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ "SourceTree"), made by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/ "Atlassian") (Which is actually not that strange since we use Confluence and Jira, other products of Atlassian, on a daily basis as well). It's a convenient GUI to do your Git-related work, in a very visual and intuitive way. Yet, sometimes command-line beats the crap out of GUI-programs, and ofcourse you need to know the underlying techniques. I love command-line for a long time, always been the Linux-guy (although, unfortunately I have to work with Windows in my professional job, and [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/ "Cygwin") isn't that great). Now I must say that the oldskool man-pages for Git are not that informative (allthough [cheatsheets](https://na1.salesforce.com/help/pdfs/en/salesforce_git_developer_cheatsheet.pdf "Git Cheatsheet") help!), and so I was looking for something different.

## Tutorial:

A colleague of mine came up with a very informative and visual tool to learn how Git works. It is on Github, even the source code of it. Have a look at an awesome tool created by [Peter Cottle](http://petermcottle.com/ "Peter Cottle").

The tutorial can be found here: [http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/ "Learn Git Branching on GithubIO")

I love it! Still returning to these tutorials to get a good grip on how to branch in Git using only the command-line. Do you have any more informative tutorials or tips on how to improve your experience with Git? Please leave a comment... I'd love to learn more about it.
