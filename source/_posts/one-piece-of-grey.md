My thoughts, in a poem. Not my first, never my last. Just my one piece of grey.
> This time I refuse to accept
> What reality seems to throw at me
> Survival of conflicting thoughts
> The master of zen that I can be

> Irrational logic in events
> The thinker thinks through
> Is it it just a bad turn of mind?
> Waiting is the only thing I can do

> The challenge is not to control
> That what cannot be controlled
> Answering that one question
> Without a single word being told

> The red roses will slightly fade
> Perfect scent gets carried away
> As I enter a lucid dreamstate knowing
> Tomorrow is a whole new day

> My sight gazes upon the future
> Never dwelling in the past
> A gentle smile while I close my blue eyes
> My impression will forever last

And yet...
