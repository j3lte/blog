Finally getting something done with my blog. It has been about half a year since I wrote my last piece. I was a bit done with blogging, actually. No further input, no more poems and just too busy doing other things. Well, today I decided to move my blog to [Github](https://github.com/j3lte/blog). Why? Because ever since I started working as a front-end developer, I have fallen in love with just plain old HTML again. And so, what better way to do than to just move my website to a static one?

So I still need some tweaking, but I have finally migrated all my old posts from Wordpress to [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). This was a bit of a pain in the ass, actually. Especially because I needed to redo all my posts in Markdown. Yes, the text was already there, but I had to do the formatting again.

To make sure Google would index my old blogposts again, I had to write some .htaccess rewrites, so this will probably be picked up in a week or so. Hopefully the SEO won't suck, but then again, my blog isn't really active or pretty much interesting for anyone to read...

What's next?

  * Have to update my Hexo to 3.0 (this is still on the old one)
  * <del>Tweak the layout a bit more, have some issues with the formatting of paragraphs</del> Done.
  * Write new content

Oh yeah, I started a new job. So it will be as hard as it was to write content. Maybe doing some poems again. We all love poems.
