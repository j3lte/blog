It's been a while that I've posted something new. Busy doing work and several projects on the side. Got some major things going on, that's why I have not been able to keep up with my blog. So today is a new day!

_**Update September 2014 : I had this Gist-file somewhere around. During the whole Fappening, I came to the conclusion that I should create a tool. It is still work-in-progress, but have a look at my latest NodeJS creation : [chanarchive](https://github.com/j3lte/chanarchive "chanarchive on Github")**_

A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a couple of developers, discussing new technologies. We talked about sharing knowledge, and it came to my attention that I have not shared much code in the past. Part of being able to grow knowledge is the open-source community, and so I want to share this with you. I opened up my Github account and will post various Gists on there. Feel free to contribute or comment!

I like scraping the web. I like NodeJS. Put those two things together and you come up with several new things to write and explore. I've been a fan of 4chan for a couple of years now, which is fun on some days. They have implemented a JSON API, that can be used for things like mobile apps.

So, I created a little scraper that will download every picture from a specific thread. It can be found on [Github](https://gist.github.com/j3lte/5326383).
