I've been tweeting a lot lately, and wanted to try something new. I like the [Metro UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language) "Modern UI") that comes with Windows 8, and I have been bothered by the ugly rounded look that is called "[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap")". It seems to slow down my browser experience when using Twitter. Luckily it's possible to change the look &amp; feel of any website in Firefox and Chrome. [Userstyles](http://userstyles.org/ "Userstyles")!

Here's my [Userstyle for Twitter](http://userstyles.org/styles/87885/twitter-metro), which will give you a more slick look and feel. Comments are welcome!
