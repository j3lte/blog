title: 'InnerCircle Enhancement Suite :: Chrome Extension'

A couple of months ago I started working on my first real userscript, one that would be useful. I chose The Inner Circle for the reason that I am using this website a lot (basically, because, despite [their statement that they would publish an Android app soon](https://twitter.com/InnerCircleCo/status/559442232848433152), there is still nothing there!). The userscript was functional in a couple of ways, but there was one thing missing: credibility and usage. See, most general users don't know what a userscript is, let alone use one. Plus, userscripts usually reside in places that a lot of people don't understand. And if they don't understand it, they won't use it. So this is only for the tech-savvy people I guess.

More than a month ago I was asked to write a Chrome Extension for a client of mine. Being somewhat of a noob in this particular area, it was time to dive into [developing Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions). I love learning on the job! Hell, that's how I got this job as a front-end developer in the first place, by learning everything there is to know to complete a task. Fail ten times, succeed on the eleventh time.

Anyway, the development of these extensions is underway, but unfortunately they will not be published in a normal way (or at least, not yet, that's up to the client). So I wanted to do a little bit more in my spare time. That's when I decided it was time to take the userscript and transform it into a Chrome Extension.

For now the InnerCircle Enhancement Suite is only available on the Chrome Store, it is pretty self explanatory. In time I will publish the whole thing on Github, so you can have a look at the code. Still needs some refactoring, but it works perfectly!
