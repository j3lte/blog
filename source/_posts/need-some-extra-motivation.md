Whenever I feel a bit down, or having a hard time, it always helps to find some extra motivation. It can come from anywhere, actually. People around you, a good book, or a movie. Allthough some of it is fiction, the message behind it can be pretty powerful. So, I compiled a list of a couple of Youtube videos that give me extra motivation. Love it? Share it!

## Al Pacino's motivational speech in the movie "Any given Sunday"

This one always gets me. The movie is one of my favorites, find it [here on IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146838/ "Any Given Sunday on IMDB"). The scene is pretty powerful! The message behind it for me: "Never give up. If you need others to do it, use others. Be a winner, a true winner makes everybody win, including himself. Be a teamplayer"

## Nick Vujicic - We only fail when we give up

The man who was born without arms or legs, and yet, he is more happy than most other people. His message is something that resonated in my mind. The limits you encounter in life, well, they are in your mind. What do you do when you fall down? You get up!
