Just my line of thoughts when helping a friend or loved one.

> Whenever the mountain seems endlessly high
> The summit, far up there in the sky
> Your legs are tired, your feet are sore
> Thinking you can't take it anymore
>&nbsp;
> Stop for a second, take a moment of rest
> That fictional mountain puts your mind to the test
> Close your eyes and visualize the way
> You can't reach the summit, just in one day
>&nbsp;
> I am right behind you, pointing at the clouds
> Without fear, without a stream of doubts
> You can't fall, neither can I
> All of a sudden, that mountain isn't that high
>&nbsp;
> Take my hand, feel the connection, positive energy
> We climb steady together, you and me
> No obstacle that can make me stop
> Let's beat the mountain, right to the top!
